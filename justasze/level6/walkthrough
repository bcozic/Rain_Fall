This time, we need to exploit a buffer overflow.
There is an unsafe strcpy which can be used to modify eip,
and thus redirect the flow of execution. The program tries
to call a function with the pointer of eax. If we change it,
we can call a ghost function that gives us the flag.

Once again, see Ressources/exploit.sh
