Here, we have a binary vulnerable to format string exploits.
It gets a string with fgets, and calls printf directly on it.

After that, it loads the value on the address 0x804988c on eax.
This value is 0, but it checks if it is equal to 64. Well, it can
be, with the format string exploit. We put some values in the stack, 
and see where it is loaded (with some %p).

It is the fourth. Then, we just have to use the %n argument of printf
as fourth argument to load a value into whichever adress we want.
Guess which one ?
