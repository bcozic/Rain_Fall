This one is not exactly an exploit, but rather a work of reverse engeenering.
The program will wait for inputs, parse commands, write code on some places,
and if you wrote data at the right spot, it will open you a shell. No vulnerabilities
to exploit I'm afraid.

See the source. If compiled, it will work exactly as the binary.

Ressource/exploit.sh will open us a shell as level9.
