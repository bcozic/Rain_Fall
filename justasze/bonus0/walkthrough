This level is about a buffer overflow via the strcat function.
Two buffers are fille by reading the standard input (20 characters each), and then, they are concatenated.
However, the buffer in which they are concatenated can only hold 36 characters. Thus, if the two buffers
are full or almost, an overflow occurs. Since there is little place for a script in the stack, we used the
environment here.

The script (Ressources/exploit.sh) must be called with source, not sh, because it needs to set environment variables.
