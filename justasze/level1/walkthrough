Here, we have a binary with two functions. The main, and run.
We can see the run function is not (normally) called, and gives us
a shell.
The main function will call an unsafe gets on a stack buffer of size 64.
The exploit is then easy, we overflow the buffer, add the address of the run
function on the last four bytes and... TADAAA.

The script (Ressources/exploit.sh) can be written in tmp and used as is.
