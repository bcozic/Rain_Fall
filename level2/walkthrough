So, we have a binary that will try to get a string, and strdup it in the heap.
However, it can detect a tentative of overflow, and exist the program if the
modified value for eip starts with 0xb (so any address on / near the stack).

We must then use another adress. But since the string will be placed in the
heap, we can use that adress. There is a subtlety, though: it will place the
adress we want to go near the end of the buffer (which will overwrite a part
of it, and can make the shellcode crash). To prevent that, we will cut the
nopsled in half, and put the shellcode in the middle of it. We just need a
more precise adress, which is not too hard to find, and close to the one on gdb.

The scripts which automatises the process is in the Ressources directory.
