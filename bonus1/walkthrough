This level is quite simple. We need to modify a variable on the stack which is
placed directly after a buffer. The first argument must be a number which will
be stocked in the stack. This is what we ought to modify.

If this number is greater than 9, the program will stop. Else, the program will
memcpy our second argument in the buffer. The length of memcpy is four time the
first argument. The length of the buffer is 40, so we would need to write 44 bytes,
but the max we can get (?) is 9x4 = 36.

What to do then ? Exploit the overlap. It appears that -2147483637 * 4 = 44.

As usual, see Ressource/exploit.sh
