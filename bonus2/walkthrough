This exploit is a little bit more technical. It combines previous ones.
We need to exploit an overflow created by a call to strcat with a predetermined buffer.

Luckily for us, the program, which will ask us a login and another string and greets us,
will have different messages according to our location (according to the environment
variable LANG to be correct), and thus different strings to use strcat with.

So let's tell it we are from Finland. And let's give it two long strings as arguments.
And let's but a shellcode in the environment.

What? Is that mean?

Once again, the exploit is in Ressources/ and, once again, it needs to be run with source
(environment modifications).
