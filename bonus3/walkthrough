This level is acutally quite simple. The binary is made to lead us to false
assumptions. The content of /user/home/end/.pass is read and in the stack,
which might tempt us tu try to read it, but the resolution is actually wau simpler.
The binary offers to open us a shell if the buffer is which it reads the pass is
equal (strcmp) to the first argument we send. However, it uses this argument to put a
NULL terminator inside (our outside) the buffer. If the argument is 0, the buffer will
be treated at empty, but strcmp("\0", "0") != 0

What if we send it an empty string?

Congratulations graduate!
